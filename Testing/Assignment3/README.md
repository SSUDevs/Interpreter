# Recursive Descent Parser Section
## Overview
- The goal of this portion is to build a concrete syntax tree (CST) using a recursive descent parsing technique. 
- All parsing will be done using procedurally-driven deterministic finite state automotons (DFA). 
- No table-driven DFAs will be implemented in this section. 
- The program will utilize an LCRS binary tree (Left-Child, Right-Sibling) to store the CST. 
- The program will also display the resulting CST in breadth-first order. 
- Expected output is in fancy graphics-based LCRS binary trees to make it easy to visually see the expected results for the input test files provided. 

## The development stages are:
1. **Creating Class for LCRS Tree Structure**
2. **Implement the Recursive Descent Parser**
3. **Build the CST**
4. **Display the CST in Breadth-First Order**
